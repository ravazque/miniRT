## 📖 About

"miniRT" is a project at 42 Madrid that involves creating a CPU-based raytracer written in C. This project introduces 3D computer graphics fundamentals, ray-object intersection mathematics, and teaches how to render photorealistic scenes with lighting, shadows, and multiple geometric primitives using the MiniLibX graphics library.

The goal is to implement a program that can parse scene description files and render 3D scenes with spheres, planes, cylinders, and cones, featuring real-time navigation, multiple light sources, and advanced features like textures and bump mapping.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understanding and implementing ray-tracing algorithms
- Learning 3D mathematics: vectors, rays, and geometric intersections
- Managing pixel manipulation and image rendering with MiniLibX
- Implementing interactive event handling (keyboard, mouse navigation)
- Exploring lighting models: ambient, diffuse, and specular illumination
- Understanding shadow casting and multi-light rendering
- Scene file parsing and validation

## Scene File Format (.rt)

Scene files use a simple text format to define cameras, lights, and objects:

```
# Comment line
A <ratio> <R,G,B>                           # Ambient light
C <x,y,z> <nx,ny,nz> <fov>                  # Camera
L <x,y,z> <brightness> <R,G,B>              # Point light

sp <x,y,z> <diameter> <R,G,B>               # Sphere
pl <x,y,z> <nx,ny,nz> <R,G,B>               # Plane
cy <x,y,z> <nx,ny,nz> <diameter> <h> <R,G,B> # Cylinder
co <x,y,z> <nx,ny,nz> <angle> <h> <R,G,B>   # Cone
```

### Parameter Ranges

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Ambient ratio | 0.0 - 1.0 | Intensity of ambient light |
| Light brightness | 0.0 - 1.0 | Point light intensity |
| FOV | 0 - 180 | Camera field of view in degrees |
| RGB | 0 - 255 | Color components |
| Normal vectors | -1.0 - 1.0 | Direction vectors (auto-normalized) |

### Bonus Identifiers

| Identifier | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `plc` | Plane with checkerboard pattern |
| `spt` | Sphere with texture (requires texture path) |
| `spb` | Sphere with bump map |

## Example Scene
